* If you have an older version of Firefox:

1. Go to the "Tools" menu and click "Options."
2. On the menu that pops up, click the "Privacy" button.
3. Go to "History," and click "Clear."


* I'm using Chrome.

1. Go to History on the browser menu.
2. The last item on the drop-down menu will be "Show all history." Click it.
3. A list of your browser history will pop up in a new window. A button at the top will say "Clear all browsing data."
Click that.
4. The pop-up menu will give you a drop down-menu for how much data you want to erase, and a series of options to click.
Click all of the options, and from the drop-down menu pick "the beginning of time."
5. Click "Clear browsing data."
